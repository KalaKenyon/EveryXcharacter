# Project Name

This project provides a simple Python function called `keep_every_third_character` that takes a string token as input and returns a new string containing every third character of the original token. Can be modified to do 2nd, 4th, 5th, etc characters.

## Installation

To use this code, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Open the Python file containing the code.

## Usage

The `keep_every_third_character` function can be used as follows:

```python
from your_module import keep_every_third_character

# Define the token
token = "ENTERTOKENHERE"

# Get the result
result = keep_every_third_character(token)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

Replace `"ENTERTOKENHERE"` with the actual token you want to process.

The `keep_every_third_character` function takes a string token as input and returns a new string that contains every third character of the original token. To obtain the desired result, the function uses Python slicing with a step of 3 (`token[2::3]`).
